**EXP 7 - Butterworth-Lowpass-filter** = In the field of Image Processing, Butterworth Lowpass Filter (BLPF) is used for image smoothing in the frequency domain. It removes high-frequency noise from a digital image and preserves low-frequency components. Designing a Butterworth filter involves selecting the appropriate filter order and components, usually capacitors, to achieve the desired flatness in frequency response. Butterworth filters are crucial in audio processing and communications to ensure clear signal transmission without distortion. The inductor and capacitor are reactive elements used in filters. But in the case of Butterworth filter only capacitors are used. So, the number of capacitors will decide the order of the filter. The lowpass filter is a filter that allows the signal with the frequency is lower than the cutoff frequency and attenuates the signals with the frequency is more than cutoff frequency.
